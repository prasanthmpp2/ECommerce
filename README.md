Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set values (DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET).\n2. Install dependencies:\n   - npm install\n3. Generate Prisma client and run migrations: \n   - npx prisma generate\n   - npx prisma migrate dev --name init\n4. Seed initial admin and API key: \n   - npm run prisma:seed\n   - Note: the seed prints an API key; save it somewhere secure.\n5. Start server: \n   - npm run dev\n6. Visit: \n   - http://localhost:4000/login.html (admin login)\n   - http://localhost:4000/add-product.html (requires admin login)\n\nAPI overview\n- POST /api/auth/login {email, password} -> sets HTTP-only cookie with JWT\n- POST /api/auth/logout -> clears cookie\n- GET /api/products -> public listing\n- POST /api/products/add -> requires admin JWT via cookie (add product from web UI)\n- POST /api/products/apikey -> requires x-api-key header (machine-to-machine)\n\nExample: Add product with API key\ncurl -X POST "http://localhost:4000/api/products/apikey" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: <your-key>" -d '{"title":"New Product","price":19.99}'\n\nSecurity notes\n- Use HTTPS in production and set secure cookies.\n- Rotate API keys periodically and mark compromised keys revoked.\n- Use strong JWT_SECRET and short expiry if risk is high.\n- Consider adding CSRF protections for stateful forms and stricter validation.\n- Use a WAF and monitoring/logging for production.\n\nWhat's next\n- Push these files into branch realworld-upgrade and open a PR.\n- Add CI (lint, tests), GitHub secret configuration, and an automated deployment pipeline.\n- Optional: integrate S3 for image hosting and add product image upload flow.\n````
